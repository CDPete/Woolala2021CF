# WooLaLa2020
New Build of WooLaLa mobile app built with Flutter and NodeJS

# GitHub Conventions
Develop will be our primary working branch which will be pulled into master after a review.
Checkout the develop branch and branch off from there.

Start new feature branches with: ft-feature-name
I have added a ft-facebook-login branch already

# Dev Env Startup:
Windows (Mac will be a little different)
Download Flutter:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
Follow instructions on Website

Download Android Studio (IDE we will be using to develop)
-Make sure to download the latest AndroidSDK (it will prompt you to do this)
-There are two ways to test a flutter app
  1. On an android device connected via USB
  2. (If you have an iPhone) Android device emulator on your computer (Available as a plugin in Andriod Studio that is relatively painless to setup)

The steps may be different on mac but the documentation on the flutter website will answer most of your questions. I will upload a base version of the project for us to begin working on and will work on locally for now until AWS is setup.

Supposedly this will work on iOS devicesbut I am not sure how we will test it yet. Will need a dev account from Tito ($100 fee), so we will focus on Android for now.

A Good tutorial to follow for understanding how Flutter works:
