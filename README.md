# Dev Env Startup:

Download Flutter:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
Follow instructions on Website


Download Android Studio (IDE we will be using to develop)
-Make sure to download the latest AndroidSDK (it will prompt you to do this)
-There are two ways to test a flutter app
  1. On an android device connected via USB
  2. Android device emulator on your computer

The steps may be different on mac but the documentation on the flutter website will answer most of your questions. I will upload a base version of the project for us to begin working on and will work on locally for now until AWS is setup.
